                <blockquote>“I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
                <br>
                    I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
                <br>
                    It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”<cite><strong>-Nelson Mandela</strong></cite></blockquote>
